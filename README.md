# Codility Challenges
Here are my 24 solutions to the various challenges found in the first 8 Codility Lessons, all written in C. Other than correctedness, depending on the solution, some were also tested for time and memory complexity and each one scored 100% in all categories.

The link to the challenges is here [https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/).


## 1 Iterations

*'In programming, iterating means repeating some part of your program. This lesson presents basic programming constructions that allow iterations to be performed: “for” and “while” loops.'*


## 2 Arrays

*'Array is a data-structure that can be used to store many items in one place'*


## 3 Time Complexity

*'Use of time complexity makes it easy to estimate the running time of a program. Complexity can be viewed as the maximum number of primitive operations that a program may execute such as single additions, multiplications, assignments etc.'*


## 4 Counting Elements

*'A numerical sequence can be stored in an array in various ways. In the standard approach, the consecutive numbers are usually put into the corresponding consecutive indices of the array. However, we can also store the data in a slightly different way, by making an array of counters. Each number may be counted in the array by using an index that corresponds to the value of the given number.'*


## 5 Prefix Sums

*'There is a simple yet powerful technique that allows for the fast calculation of sums of elements in given slice (contiguous segments of array). Its main idea uses prefix sums which are defined as the consecutive totals of the first 0, 1, 2, . . . , n elements of an array.'*


## 6 Sorting

*'Sorting is the process of arranging data in a certain order. Usually, we sort by the value of the elements. We can sort numbers, words, pairs, etc. For example, we can sort students by their height, and we can sort cities in alphabetical order or by their numbers of citizens. The most-used orders are numerical order and alphabetical order. However, there are many sorting algorithms, and they differ considerably in terms of their time complexity and use of memory.'*


## 7 Stack Queues

*'There are various structures used for storage of elements. The two implimented here are the stack and queue which require two operations: push (inserting the new element to the structure) and pop (removing some element from the structure).'*


## 8 Leader

*'If there is a sequence of n values, the leader of this sequence is the element whose value occurs more than n/2 times. The leader may be found in many ways. Here we investigate two of those methods.'*
