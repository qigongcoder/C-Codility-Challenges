/*
A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters
A, C, G and T, which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides
in the sequence. Each nucleotide has an impact factor, which is
an integer. Nucleotides of types A, C, G and T have impact
factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. You are going to answer
several queries of the form: What is the minimal impact factor
of nucleotides contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?

The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1]
consisting of N characters. There are M queries, which are given in
non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting of M integers.
The K-th query (0 â‰¤ K < M) requires you to find the minimal impact
factor of nucleotides contained in the DNA sequence between positions
P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).

For example, consider string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:
    P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
    P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
    P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6
the function should return the values [2, 4, 1].
